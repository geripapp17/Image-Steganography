# Image-Steganography

Steganography is the technique of hiding information inside of a container to conceal the communication.

In this project I have created an application, with which the user can hide information inside image and video files. The program gives the opportunity for the user to define what color channels, bit numbers, bit indexes and strides to use for encoding and decodeing.

In the application is implemented the so called Simple Steganography, which means that only lossles container files can be used to store data inside of it.

The application has a GUI, which is implemented in Qt 5.15, and uses OpenCV to process the image and video files.
